# Big-Data-Uwaterloo-2016
Big Data course projects

```
What is this course about? This course provides an introduction to big data infrastructure for analytics. The focus is algorithm design and "thinking at scale": we will cover data mining and machine learning techniques as applied to text, graphs, and relational data. Most of the course will be taught in a combination of MapReduce and Spark, two representative dataflow abstractions for large-scale data analysis, although we will introduce alternative abstractions such as bulk-synchronous parallel and streaming models as well.
